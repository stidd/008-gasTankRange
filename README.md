Some cars have a nice feature that shows the driver not just how much more gas is in the tank but how many miles can be driven with the gas left in the tank. Write a function called gasTankRange that takes two parameters.

averageMPG: the average miles per gallon fuel economy of the car. 
gasInTank: the total gallons currently in the tank.


Have the function take those items as input (in that order) and give the output of the number of miles that the car can be driven till its tank is empty.
